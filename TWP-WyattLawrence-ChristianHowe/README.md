This program utilizes JavaFX to create a UI. The user enters the search text, can choose between most recent and most frequent editors, and get the list returned.

 Upon test-running JavaFX, we kept running into the error of "Exception in Application constructor." With experimentation, we discovered that our code ran in David Largent's program "UI Translator" (after converting that to Maven). We brought all our code over into that project and deleted all of David Largent's code in that project. Because David Largent made past commits to that project, he is listed as a contributer in our GitHub repository.
